# Figures from the Elements of Statistical Learning
I tried to recreate all figures from the textbook The Elements of Statistical Learning (2nd edition) by Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman with R using mainly ggplot2 and [mlr](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr).

See https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/ where you can get a PDF of the book.

You find the figures along with the R code in the following notebooks:

1. [Introduction](https://github.com/BodoBurger/hastie-ElemStatLearn-figures/blob/master/01-Introduction.md)
2. [Overview of Supervised Learning](https://github.com/BodoBurger/hastie-ElemStatLearn-figures/blob/master/02-Overview-Supervised-Learning.md)
